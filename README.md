### 🌟 About Me  
I’m a **2nd-year IT student** currently building strong foundations in **Python and problem-solving**,  
with a clear long-term goal of becoming an **AI/ML Engineer**.

Right now, I’m focused on:
- learning core programming concepts properly  
- understanding logic, data structures, and workflows  
- building small but meaningful projects and improving them step by step  

💭 *I value progress over perfection and believe skills are built through consistency.*
